# dynamic-mapping

dynamic-mapping is a dynamic datatype handing Package.

## Description

The dynamic-mapping is...

- simple.
    - There are shortcode and fewer options.

- able to be used as core library.
    - You can concentrate to develop your logic by using core libraries.

## Motivation

go datatypes have various forms depending on data especily in API response data.
This problem has been solved with many options (e.g. interface and struct)
It is difficult to adapt to the application with Json data response from API callbacks, therefore it is necessary to manipulate long dynamic datatypes.
I think it is better to code it yourself from the beginning.

The dynamic-mapping wants to solve these problems.
